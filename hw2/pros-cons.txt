Pros and Cons - Accessibility Tools

NoCoffee:
- Pros: Really easy to simulate vision issues and disabilities, with sliders to control effects displayed.
- Cons: Link in slides goes to 404. 'Flutter' effect is very disorienting! Extension remains active across entire browser window (multiple tabs). Some effects linger after resetting until page is refreshed.

Tota11y:
- Pros: Works on websites without needing to download extension or embed code! Javascript is awesome. Detailed analysis of issues with suggested solutions.
- Cons: May not work as intended on Javascript-heavy apps (namespace collisions?), some browsers may disable JS

Silktide:
- Pros: N/A (request for demo was unanswered)
- Cons: Not as accessible to use as previous two tools
